# Module 2 Challenge

## Overview of Project
Steve has been working on analyzing stock data for his parents. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a code that can efficiently go through thousands of stock information. The goal of this project is to increase the efficiency of the original code by refactoring it.

## Results
- In 2017 SPWR and FSLR had the highest volume. In 2018 SPWR and ENPH had the highest volume.
- Unfortunately my refactored code has a run time that is slower than the original code. But if I have refactored it correctly, the refactored code should be faster than the original code. 

## Summary
If a code is refactored correctly, the biggest advantage would be the increase in efficiency. The Disadvantages are the possibility of errors. When refactoring is not done correctly, the code can become unusable or can even be a waste of time.
